# Web Framework developed using flask

## Write a script that starts a Flask web application:
 - [0-hello_route](0-hello_route.py)
   - Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
   - Routes:
     - /: display “Hello HBNB!”
     - You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition
